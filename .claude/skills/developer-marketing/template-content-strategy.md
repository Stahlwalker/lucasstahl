# Developer Content Strategy Template

This template helps you create a comprehensive developer content strategy based on the "trust first, pipeline second" philosophy from [Luke Stahl's Developer Marketing Handbook](https://lukestahl.io/handbook/).

**Instructions:** Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` text with your specific details. Delete sections that don't apply to your organization.

## **DACI**

| **Role**     | **Person/Team**                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Driver       | [Name - person leading strategy execution]                                     |
| Approver     | [Names - people who must approve strategy decisions]                           |
| Contributors | [Teams - groups executing strategy: content, DevRel, SEO, design, engineering] |
| Informed     | [Names - stakeholders who need updates]                                        |

**Note:** Clarify who drives vs. who executes. Developer content often requires cross-functional execution (DevRel, Content, SEO, Community, Product).

---

## **Prioritize the following steps**

Identify what must happen now (P0) vs. what can be figured out later. Include clear deadlines and owners.

| **Section**           | **P0 Recommendation**                                                                 | **Target Date / Status** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Goals & OKRs          | [What you're aligning to - product adoption, awareness, developer-influenced revenue] | [Date or milestone]      |
| Developer Personas    | [Who you're writing for - front-end devs, CTOs, architects]                           | [Date or milestone]      |
| Content Types         | [What formats you'll prioritize - tutorials, guides, blog posts]                      | [Date or milestone]      |
| Distribution Channels | [Where content will be published - blog, YouTube, Reddit]                             | [Date or milestone]      |

---

### **Open Questions**

Capture unresolved items that may impact execution. Revisit regularly.

**Current Open Questions**

- [Example: Where will integration tutorials live - Developer Hub or separate integrations section?]
- [Example: Who owns video production for technical content?]
- [Example: What's the measurement dashboard we'll use to track developer content performance?]
- [Example: How does this strategy align with Product/Engineering documentation efforts?]
- [Example: What's the content calendar tool and who maintains it?]

---

## **1. Aligning with Team Goals and Objectives**

**P0 Recommendation:** [Describe how developer content ladders up to company/team OKRs]

This strategy supports [Company Name]'s goals by:

- **[Goal 2]**: [How developer content contributes - e.g., "Build trust with technical decision-makers"]
- **[Goal 3]**: [How developer content contributes - e.g., "Increase product-qualified leads from developer audience"]

**OKR Key for Reference**

- **[OKR 2]**: [Brief description]
- **[Team OKR]**: [Relevant team-level objective]

---

## **2. Developer Personas**

## **9. Content Governance**

Content governance ensures technical quality, brand alignment, and clarity.

### **Core Guidelines**

- **Technical Accuracy**: All code examples, API usage, and product claims must be verified
- **Tone Standards**: [Clear, respectful, credible - avoid hype or marketing fluff]
- **Inclusive Language**: Follow [company style guide or industry standards]
- **Readability**: Short paragraphs, clear headers, working code examples

### **AI Tools and Process**

- Content may use AI for drafting and editing, but must be reviewed by subject matter experts
- [Optional: Custom GPT or fine-tuned model trained on company tone and messaging]
- Encourage SME contributions via [Loom recordings, async interviews] for authenticity

### **Tone Guidance by Content Bucket**

- **Acquisition, Enablement, Convert Paid**: Clear, practical, no fluff
- **Awareness**: May use bold or provocative language to spark conversation, but must remain credible

### **Visual Standards**

Developer content should not be text-only:

- Use **diagrams** for architecture, data flow, or logic (e.g., Mermaid diagrams)
- Include **video snippets** or **screencasts** showing workflows
- Embed **live examples**, **code sandboxes**, or **screenshots** for clarity

**Recommendation:** Require visual or code examples in all technical content. Maintain credibility even in awareness content.
