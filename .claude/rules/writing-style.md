# Writing Style Rules

When generating or creating content for pages (new or existing), documentation, or site copy, always reference `docs/Lukes-Developer-Writing-Style.md` for tone, style, and formatting guidelines.

**This applies to:**
- AI-generated page content (homepage, about, projects, etc.)
- New page creation
- Documentation updates
- Site copy revisions
- Any written content for the website

**Note:** Blog posts are written by Luke in Notion and don't require AI generation.

This ensures consistency across all AI-generated content on lukestahl.io.
